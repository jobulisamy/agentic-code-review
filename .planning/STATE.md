## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Claude API (Anthropic) chosen; SQLite for local-only v1; FastAPI async; GitHub App for webhooks; structured JSON via tool_use
- [Research]: Use `aiosqlite` driver — mandatory for 30s SLA with async pipeline; Alembic from day one even for SQLite
- [Research]: Phase 4 (GitHub) is highest-risk — diff-position mapping (not file line numbers) and HMAC on raw bytes are the two most likely blockers

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 flag]: Claude tool_use / structured output API shape should be verified against Anthropic SDK 0.84.0 docs before writing `services/claude.py`
- [Phase 4 flag]: GitHub diff-position arithmetic and `unidiff` library API should be validated against a real PR diff before writing the comment poster; recommend `/gsd:research-phase` before Phase 4 planning
